## Demo

CS4640 Server URL: https://cs4640.cs.virginia.edu/mjm7ngb/cs4640project/<br>


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and JavaScript


### Installing

* Clone the repository or download the zip

### Notes for Devs
* Remember to add new commands to the $authRequired list in index.php

### TODO (Things we would have liked to implement)
- [ ] Handle event deletion (automatic when calendar page is loaded if time has passed, manual from event.php)
- [ ] Color days in the calendar that have scheduled events different than the rest (will likely need AJAX, can be done after sprint).
- [ ] Autopopulate date/time in new event form when accesses via the calendar itself, based on the day clicked (jQuery)
- [ ] Possibly add image gallery to bottom of profile page with image upload ability.
